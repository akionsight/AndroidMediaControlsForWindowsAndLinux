# Android Headset Media Controls for Windows
Python script that hacks in support for Android headset media control for Windows and Linux

For more details on how this works, see the associated [blog post](http://www.roligheten.no/blog/programming/2018/07/02/media-controls-windows.html)

## Installation

### On Windows
Regardless of the platform the following is required
1. Python 3 or 2.7 (untested) installed on the system.
2. The packages pywin32 and sounddevice, installable via `pip install pywin32 sounddevice`.
### On Linux
1. Install python3 via `sudo apt install python3`
2. install packages sounddevice and numpy `pip3 install numpy`
3. install xdotool (emulates key presses) `sudo apt install xdotool`

### Windows
1. Download a copy of this repository from [here](https://github.com/Catuna/AndroidMediaControlsWindows/archive/master.zip)
2. Extract to an appropriate location on your system, where doesn't matter as long as you don't accidentally delete it.
3. Navigate to the following directory:

    `C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
4. Create a shortcut via File->New->Shortcut in the directory.

   When asked to specify location point it to where 'pythonw.exe' is installed.
   
   This is usually at:
   `C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python<version>\pythonw.exe`
   
   When prompted for shortcut name just keep the default.
5. Right-click the new shortcut and open 'properties'
6. At the end of 'target' add the path where you installed the 'run.py' script to the end of the string.
   
   For example:
   
   Target: `<path to pythonw.exe> C:\Programs\audiocontrols\run.py`
   
7. Restart your computer. At this point you should find 'pythonw.exe' running in the task mananger under 'Background Processes' and the program should function.

### Linux and Mac
Sorry, the script currently only works for Windows at the moment, feel free to contribute code for other platforms if you have the time.
